Predicting user ratings from textual reviews has become an essential task for recommendation systems, sentiment analysis, and user preference modeling. This study explores the effectiveness of various methodologies for predicting user ratings using a large dataset of restaurant reviews. Leveraging the Google Restaurant Dataset, which includes over 1.4 million reviews with rich textual and metadata features, we compare baseline approaches, traditional statistical models, and modern deep learning techniques. Our experiments evaluate models ranging from user-specific average rating predictions to state-of-the-art approaches, including TF-IDF-based methods, fine-tuned BERT, and OpenAI-v3-Large embeddings paired with classifiers. The results reveal that traditional TF-IDF methods, while efficient, are outperformed by neural architectures, with OpenAI-v3-Large achieving the highest accuracy of 80.0%. Detailed exploratory data analysis uncovers correlations between textual sentiment and numerical ratings, highlighting the interplay between user preferences and review content.
